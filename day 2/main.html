   <h1>q5. Compute the average and grade of the students</h1>
   <br>
   <h1>q7. Write a JavaScript program which iterates the integers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"</h1>
   <br>
   <h1>q8. Happy Numbers:

    According to Wikipedia a happy number is defined by the following process : "Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers (or sad numbers)". Write a JavaScript program to find and print the first 5 happy numbers
</h1>
